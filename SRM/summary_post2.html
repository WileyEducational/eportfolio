									The CVSS is mostly criticized by Spring et al. (2021) for its misuse as a Risk Assessment tool. Analyzing the proposed literature stated by the article all three sources introduce the CVSS as a vulnerability assessment tool (Scarfone et al., 2008; Souppaya and Scarfone, 2013; PCI security standards, 2022). Most of the critical claims made by Spring et al. (2021) seem to originate from the interpretation of terminology between vulnerability and risk, which Wolf (2012) compared to the Babylonian confusion.
                                    <br><br>
									Therefore to rightfully analyze the article by Spring et al. (2021), it is important to define these terms. Stallings and Brown (2015) distinguish between vulnerabilities, threats, and risks. This article makes a correlation between these three and how they complement and evolve into eventually a risk. As claimed by the CVSS, the calculator should not be used for a risk score.
                                    <br><br>
									This does not remove the misinterpretation and therefore the misuse of the CVSS tool. There are some metrics involved that look into the further stages of vulnerabilities, namely threats and risks. Even though there are a lot of methods to calculate risks, they all circle back to the simple equation that risk = likelihood *Impact. Although Spring et al. (2021) make a valid argument on the scientific validation of the CVSS, there are use cases to use the tool to get an understanding of the impact. Spring et al. (2021) also name examples of risk controls, like input validation, this control will lower the likelihood of the risk but not the impact, resulting in an effectively lower risk. However, some introduced metrics by CVSS do tend to focus on the “likelihood” factor of risk assessment, such as the Remediation Level (RL) metric, further allowing for the confusion between vulnerabilities and risks.
                                    <br><br>
									Spring et al. (2021) propose their own Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) as an alternative approach to CVSS. SSVC is a decision tree that will instead of answering the severity of a vulnerability answer how you should treat these vulnerabilities, e.g. immediately respond (Spring et al., 2019). However, just like CVSS, SSVC is a tool that is focused on vulnerability management and not risk management. Therefore SSVC suffers from the same downfall that likelihood and risk management controls that target likelihood, are not considered in their quantitative analysis and outcome.
									<br><br>
									Both tools could be useful to estimate the inherent risk, where no risk management controls are implemented. This information is very useful as it will identify areas of high impact. However, as also argued by Spring et al. (2021) there are seldom no controls in place. Therefore an additional risk assessment should take place estimating the residual risk based on the implemented controls. Having both of these resources available will give an organization a great insight into their risk landscape and offering more control over their risks and risk management processes (Coetzee and Lubbe, 2014).
