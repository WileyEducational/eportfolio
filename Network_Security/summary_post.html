									This summary post focuses on the initial post done on November 13th, 2023, as well as the content of the first three units of the Network Security course. The initial post focused on transitioning from a traditional brick-and-mortar SME to becoming fully digital. “Being” fully digital is defined as: “Business, operating, and customer models are optimized for digital and profoundly different from prior business, operating and customer models” (Wei, Sanbron and Slaughter, 2019)
                                    <br><br>
									Implementing more digital technologies within the business broadens the “cyber”-surface and thus creates new risks for organizations. Implementing these technologies can be done via a secure-by-design principle. Both unit 2 and unit 3 have given more insight into analyzing vulnerabilities. Doing a vulnerability assessment before employing a new technology can strengthen the risk assessment of the entire business and mitigations can be taken into account before “securely” deploying a new technology.
                                    <br><br>
									Dr. Nawaz Khan had an interesting question, Do I believe digitalization can also help transmission and energy providers optimize grid capacity as well as meet carbon targets? I do believe that adopting digital technologies enhances productivity in a general sense. The more digitalization is adopted within the energy industry, the more the boundaries of what was previously thought to be impossible will move.
                                    <br><br>
                                    To add to this, I also strongly believe that this should be gained in a controlled manner. Still a lot of SMEs of the misconception of being not interesting enough for a cyber attack (Chidukwani, Zander, and Koutsakis, 2022). As described by Moşteanu (2020) data is quickly becoming the most valuable, meaning that employing any form of digitalization should be well thought through to protect this valuable asset. If an organization is “behind” on digitalization one can take a more strategic approach to best practices of employing certain technologies. The Gartner Hype Cycle (Gartner Hype Cycle Research Methodology, no date) is a very powerful tool to select relevant technologies from.
