								Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are designed to attack the availability of the victim’s resources. 
								In case of a possible successful attack, it is one of the most visible ones, since resources are limited to not available resulting in frustrated users, lost business, and a damaged reputation. 
								The Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack has a growing number of reported incidents, making it one of the most important and fatal threats (Mansfield-Devine, 2015). 
								The goal of these attacks is to obstruct the legitimate flow of traffic by flooding the target with traffic. 
								The seriousness of this attack can be found in an example that was provided by Dr. Maria Alvanou: in November 2022 a DDoS attack originating from the Netherlands was responsible for 800 websites of the Greece government being frozen, even blocking electronic prescriptions (Τσιλιόπουλος, 2022). 
								This summary post will focus on two cyber security technologies that help protect against DDoS attacks.
								<br><br>
								The first proposed technology is to adopt a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in the network design in combination with a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW). 
								A DMZ is a carefully controlled perimeter network that is used as a barrier between public or non-trusted networks and internal or protected networks (Rogers, 2022). 
								The performance of a DMZ is more effective if it is employed in combination with one or two firewalls (s) (Rababah, Zhou, and Bader, 2018). 
								Patel (2020) has demonstrated that a network designed with one firewall (Cisco ASA) provided enhanced security and performance against TCP SYN flood and ICMP flood attacks. 
								This, however, as stated in response to the initial response by Abdallah Hamad,  only protects against DDoS attacks on the network layer of the OSI model, and thus the use of Web Application Firewalls was proposed. 
								Although this is absolutely true, it is better to enhance the security design of Patel (2020) by switching out the traditional firewall in favor of an NGFW. 
								NGFWs have functionalities that protect against layer 3, 4, and 7 (the application layer) attacks, resulting in the most complete protection in the network design (J. Liang and Y. Kim, 2022). 
								Leaving the designing and employing of this technology the biggest challenge, especially in virtual environments, such as complexity, and risk of misconfiguration (Kasapovic and Biberkic, 2015).

								One of the most visible cyber-attacks for end users is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack. 
								The attack targets the availability of the victim’s resources resulting in frustrated users, lost business, and a damaged reputation. 
								The Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack has a growing number of reported incidents, making it one of the most important and fatal threats (Mansfield-Devine, 2015). 
								A DDoS attack generates flooding traffic to a specific resource to obstruct the legitimate flow of information. This post will identify and discuss two security technologies to tackle DDoS attacks and how they can be employed within an organization.
								<br><br>
								One possible technology to protect against a DDoS attack is utilizing a Demilitarized zone (DMZ) in the network design. 
								A DMZ is a carefully controlled perimeter network that is used as a barrier between public or non-trusted networks and internal or protected networks (Rogers, 2022). 
								The performance of DMZ is mostly effective in combination with one or two firewalls (Rababah, Zhou and Bader, 2018). 
								The research of Patel (2020) shows that a network designed with one firewall (Cisco ASA) provided enhanced security and performance against TCP SYN flood and ICMP flood attacks.

									<p>Summary on: Discussion on why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</p>

							<p>
								The initial post discussed why Cyber Security is a global issue and the importance for organizations to invest in Cyber Security. 
								Since communications go over traditional lines there is a hypothetical possibility and necessity to define cyber borders and secure them (Osborn, 2017). 
								As well noticed by Kemi Fadiya based on the finding of Kennedy (2014): 
								“the internet being global and the cyberspace unregulated, it is the responsibility of governments and companies to secure their networks as the repercussions of a cyber-attack not only affects them but society at large”.
								<br><br>
								As stated in the original post, this responsibility as described in this quote is mostly taken after an impactful incident (Arroyabe et al., 2023). 
								Reflecting on the example of the initial post, the cyber-attack by Lapsus$ on Uber, it is clear that Uber's investments changed after the incident. 
								Uber opened up 80 job openings that required cybersecurity professionals (Sundravelu, 2022).

								<p>The interconnection between devices globally, via for example the internet, creates the popular belief that cyberspace holds no borders. 
									Although not as acknowledged and clear as physical borders, there most definitely is a necessity to define cyber borders and secure them as discussed by Osborn (2017).
								
									<br><br>
									Cyberspace philosophically speaking aims to create a more open world and society. 
									This open world means that, although we have the rise of cyber borders, there should be little to no problems to connect with the entire world. 
									Every possible threat to this open cyberspace is considered part of the “cyber threat landscape”. 
									As technology and digitalization are advancing at an alarming pace so does the magnitude of cyberspace and the “cyber threat landscape”.
