								<p>The interconnection between devices globally, via for example the internet, creates the popular belief that cyberspace holds no borders. 
									Although not as acknowledged and clear as physical borders, there most definitely is a necessity to define cyber borders and secure them as discussed by Osborn (2017).
								
									<br><br>
									Cyberspace philosophically speaking aims to create a more open world and society. 
									This open world means that, although we have the rise of cyber borders, there should be little to no problems to connect with the entire world. 
									Every possible threat to this open cyberspace is considered part of the “cyber threat landscape”. 
									As technology and digitalization are advancing at an alarming pace so does the magnitude of cyberspace and the “cyber threat landscape”.

									<br><br>
									This growth, especially in the “cyber threat landscape”, makes it more important for companies around the world to invest in their Cyber Security. 
									The 2022 Cybersecurity Workforce Study not only shows a shortage of 3.4 million Cyber Security worldwide but also more than half of employees at organizations with workforce shortages feel that staff deficits put their organization at a “moderate” or “extreme” risk of cyberattack ((ISC)2, 2022).
									
									<br><br>
									Investing in an adequate cyber security workforce can help a company predict, prevent, detect, and respond to a cyber-attack. 
									Unfortunately, a lot of companies invest after an impactful incident (Arroyabe et al., 2023). 
									One such example is the Uber hack in 2022 by Lapsus$. The UK Metro News reported that one week after the incident Uber posted 80 jobs in its US security department (Sundravelu, 2022).
									
									<br><br>
									The hack on Uber did not have an enormous financial gain for Lapsus$, the damage to the Uber brand on the other hand was significant. 
									This could also have partially been the reason why Uber posted many jobs after the incident. 
									Showing the outside world that it is taking the incident seriously and wants to better its future Cyber Security and thus minimizing the damage to the Uber brand.

									<br><br>
									In conclusion, companies should take the opinions of their Cyber Security experts in high regard. shortcomings in investments in the quality of the Cyber Security workforce can lead directly to financial losses but also to greater name damage.
