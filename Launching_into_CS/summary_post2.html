									Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are designed to attack the availability of the victim’s resources. 
									In case of a possible successful attack, it is one of the most visible ones, since resources are limited to not available resulting in frustrated users, lost business, and a damaged reputation. 
									The Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack has a growing number of reported incidents, making it one of the most important and fatal threats (Mansfield-Devine, 2015). 
									The goal of these attacks is to obstruct the legitimate flow of traffic by flooding the target with traffic. 
									The seriousness of this attack can be found in an example that was provided by Dr. Maria Alvanou: in November 2022 a DDoS attack originating from the Netherlands was responsible for 800 websites of the Greece government being frozen, even blocking electronic prescriptions (Τσιλιόπουλος, 2022). 
									This summary post will focus on two cyber security technologies that help protect against DDoS attacks.
								<br><br>
									The first proposed technology is to adopt a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in the network design in combination with a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW). 
									A DMZ is a carefully controlled perimeter network that is used as a barrier between public or non-trusted networks and internal or protected networks (Rogers, 2022). 
									The performance of a DMZ is more effective if it is employed in combination with one or two firewalls (s) (Rababah, Zhou, and Bader, 2018). 
									Patel (2020) has demonstrated that a network designed with one firewall (Cisco ASA) provided enhanced security and performance against TCP SYN flood and ICMP flood attacks. 
									This, however, as stated in response to the initial response by Abdallah Hamad,  only protects against DDoS attacks on the network layer of the OSI model, and thus the use of Web Application Firewalls was proposed. 
									Although this is absolutely true, it is better to enhance the security design of Patel (2020) by switching out the traditional firewall in favor of an NGFW. 
									NGFWs have functionalities that protect against layer 3, 4, and 7 (the application layer) attacks, resulting in the most complete protection in the network design (J. Liang and Y. Kim, 2022). 
									Leaving the designing and employing of this technology the biggest challenge, especially in virtual environments, such as complexity, and risk of misconfiguration (Kasapovic and Biberkic, 2015).
								<br><br>
									The other proposed technology is also a method to protect against application layer DDoS attacks. 
									This is done by validating legitimate users by enforcing a challenge-response authentication, with the best-known example being CAPTCHA. 
									The prime benefit of using CAPTCHA over other methods is that it is very cost-efficient, however, the enormous growth in computational power and artificial intelligence over the last few years makes it so that computers can easily tackle challenge-response authentication.
									The most well-known example that demonstrates this weakness can be found in the ticketing industry, where tickets get scalped by bots leaving legitimate buyers without a ticket (E. Kaiser and W. -c. Feng, 2010). 
									Another approach that might be more effective is a proof-of-work system, which requires more resources from a user than the weaker CAPTCHA. 
									Although in theory, a proof-of-work system would provide more security it is proven to be an uneconomical approach that highly affects the usability of a system (Laurie and Clayton, 2004). 
									Although there is promising research like Patil (2023) in making proof-of-work puzzles a viable applicable technique, for now, the better option is to use CAPTCHA to defend against application layer DDoS Attacks.
