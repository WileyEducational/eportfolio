								<p>
                                    The initial post discussed why Cyber Security is a global issue and the importance for organizations to invest in Cyber Security. 
                                    Since communications go over traditional lines there is a hypothetical possibility and necessity to define cyber borders and secure them (Osborn, 2017). 
                                    As well noticed by Kemi Fadiya based on the finding of Kennedy (2014): 
                                    “the internet being global and the cyberspace unregulated, it is the responsibility of governments and companies to secure their networks as the repercussions of a cyber-attack not only affects them but society at large”.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As stated in the original post, this responsibility as described in this quote is mostly taken after an impactful incident (Arroyabe et al., 2023). 
                                    Reflecting on the example of the initial post, the cyber-attack by Lapsus$ on Uber, it is clear that Uber's investments changed after the incident. 
                                    Uber opened up 80 job openings that required cybersecurity professionals (Sundravelu, 2022).
                                    <br><br>
                                    Another statement made by Kemi Fadiya was about not reporting the data breach as obliged. 
                                    This however was an article about an earlier breach on Uber in 2016, that the former CEO tried to cover up (The Associated Press, 2022). 
                                    However, in the case of the Lapsus$ breach, the attackers directly informed both security researchers on the HackerOne platform and Uber personnel on their Slack workspace, leaving Uber no choice but to acknowledge the breach.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Kemi Fadiya also stated that in the UK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates that all organizations should report personal data breaches within 72 hours of being made aware of the breach taking place (ICO, 2023). 
                                    Although the former statement is more than true, looking at the job offerings placed by Uber as described by Sundravelu in the Metro News (2022), this attack likely targeted the New York network. 
                                    Therefore it is highly likely that this attack is subject to the NYS Information Security Breach and Notification Act rather than the UK GDPR, even though the actual victims could be people from around the globe.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The Lapsus$ attack was the third major breach suffered by Uber after the attacks in 2014 and 2016. 
                                    The attack in 2022 is the only one that directly resulted in hiring more cybersecurity professionals, supporting the theory posed by Arroyabe et al (2023).
                                    <br><br>
                                    In conclusion, this attack was not detected at an early stage but only came to light after the hacker announced itself and the damages. 
                                    Seeing the scope of this attack Uber did not have proper professionals in terms of predicting, preventing, and detecting this attack. 
                                    Seeing the job openings after the attack happened also implies missing competence in responding to this attack. 
                                    Organizations all over the world should take this example of Uber about the importance of investing in cybersecurity before an attack instead of investing after being a victim of (multiple) attack(s).
