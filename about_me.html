									My name is Wiley Finch and although my name might suggest otherwise I was born and raised in the Netherlands.
									<br><br>
									I still live and work in the Netherlands. I’ve had numerous jobs in the IT field. During my studies, I started working as a full-stack developer and gradually transitioned over to Cyber Security. In the same transition, I got to working in the OT world rather than the IT world, which based on the standard in the OT world has unique challenges regarding Cyber Security.
									<br><br>
									After a couple of years of working experience, I joined the University of Applied Sciences Inholland as a lecturer. Which was a sort of homecoming considering I joined the same program I successfully graduated with my BSc. As a lecturer, I create course material and give lectures on coding (C# and Python) next to some (red teaming) security workshops.
									<br><br>
									My love and ambition for Cyber Security have only grown over the years. That is why I decided to advance my skills in an academic course and aim for an MSc in Cyber Security. A big challenge for me personally is combining this with my personal and working life. Next to my full-time job, I’m also a father of three (which might be even more challenging than a full-time job).
									<br><br>
									I’m very excited to start the program with fellow enthusiasts and get to know you all (online). I wish all joining the program the best of luck!
